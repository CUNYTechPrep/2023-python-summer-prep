## For those of you having login / auth issues with Github... You need to update your git. This should solve that problem.

1. Quit all terminal applications you have open. 
2. Download and install git. [Download and follow instructions here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
	* __Mac users__ if you are getting a `homebrew` error. You need to [install homebrew via instructions here](https://brew.sh/)
	* __Windows users__ (gross j/k), Download the Standalone Installer not the Portable one.  
3. Once you've successfully installed the latest version of git, now open up your terminal and try and push your commits. 
4. Again, the instructions for adding changes to github are [here](https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/2023-python-summer-prep/tree/main/week-03#step-1-adding-your-file). 
	* Open your terminal and __MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE PROPER FOLDER__ which is where your github files are.
	* `git add [your file name here]`
	* `git commit -m 'your commit message here'`
	* `git push`
6. A dialogue window should now open, and login to github there and you should be all good to go now. 


###  If your github is still being SUPER DUPER silly...
You might need to add and ssh key.  Follow the [instructions here CAREFULLY](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) as they are a very detailed.
